We sit and wait to discover
That winter's overcome
We can't explain or define it
We know there's something wrong

We sit and wait to discover
That winter's overcome
We should refrain from mournin'
And try to do what's right

But when winter loses faith
Like summer in December
And when summer gets in the way
I'm bound to be blown away

We'll blow her away

And all of the mistakes we've made,
We always will remember,
We can't explain or define it,
We know there's something wrong

When winter looses faith,
Like summer in December,
And when summer gets in the way,
We're bound to be blown away,
We'll blow her away
We'll blow her away
We'll blow her away
We'll blow her away

We'll blow her away
And in the summer
We'll blow her away
And in the summer
We'll blow her away...
