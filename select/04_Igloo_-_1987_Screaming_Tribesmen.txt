Well I live in an igloo at the polar zone
And at night I dream of a red telephone
I felt so lonely when my samoyed died
And I felt my tears freeze when I finally cried

It's all white
It's all white
It's all white
All around me white
It's all white
It's all white
It's all white

Well I tried to make friends with the eskimo
Oh but his thoughts were buried deep in the ice and snow
It was such a desperate day when I sеarched for food
Oh just to wander herе I don't know what to do
Listen to the shoe shine boys

It's all white
It's all white
It's all white
All around me white
It's all white
It's all white
It's all white
